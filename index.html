        My name is Stuti Kashyap and I am in 6th grade. I am very excited to learn how to code on Brackets as this is my first time. Here are some quick facts about myself. I love to code, play Table Tennis, play piano, sketch, paint, cooking and,learn new languages. My favorite color is Sea Blue. My favorite food is Lasagna.
